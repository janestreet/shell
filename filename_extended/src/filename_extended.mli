    Note: This function is context independent, use [expand] if you want to consider
    relatives paths from a given point.

    In particular:
    - A directory is always the parent of itself.
    - The root is the parent of any directory
    - An absolute path is never the parent of relative one and vice versa.
    - ["../../a"] is never the parent of ["."] even if this could be true given form the
      current working directory. *)
